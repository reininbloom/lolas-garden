            <!-- Rose -->
            <div class="flower-card">
                <img src="images/rose.jpg" alt="Pink Rose">
                <h3>Rose (<em>Rosa</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    This is my lola’s favorite flower. To her, it’s almost like gold. 
                    She rarely lets anyone pick it, as if it were something precious and ancient. 
                    The soft pink petals remind me of her — sweet and beautiful, just like her smile. 
                    It’s even the same color as her house, because she loves pink. 
                    Watching her take care of this flower always makes the garden feel warmer.

            <div class="flower-card">
                <img src="images/yellow-alder.jpg" alt="Yellow Alder">
                <h3>Yellow Alder (<em>Turnera ulmifolia</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    This flower feels like happiness in bloom. Its yellow petals shine like the morning sunrise. 
                    It grows near the doorway of her veranda, quietly welcoming everyone who enters. 
                    It brightens that small corner of her home, as if greeting visitors with a gentle smile.

            <!-- Cosmos -->
            <div class="flower-card">
                <img src="images/cosmos.jpg" alt="Cosmos Flower">
                <h3>Cosmos (<em>Cosmos bipinnatus</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    Like the other flowers in her garden, this one is also treasured. 
                    Even though many cosmos bloom there, my lola rarely picks them. 
                    Their soft petals and gentle colors give the garden a quiet, delicate feeling. 
                    They look light and graceful, moving softly with the breeze, adding calmness to her space.

                <h3>Ixora (Santan) (<em>Ixora coccinea</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    This flower is one of the oldest in my lola’s garden. I remember seeing it when I was still a child, 
                    and it is still there now. We call it santan. As kids, we used to sip the tiny drop of nectar from its petals. 
                    It carries memories of simple afternoons and small joys. Even today, it reminds me of warmth and the kind of happiness that stays.

                <h3>Blue Elfin (<em>Pseuderanthemum laxiflorum</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    This one is a more recent addition to the garden. Its purple-blue color feels almost magical among the greens. 
                    It stands out quietly, bringing a different kind of beauty. 
                    It’s calming to look at, adding something unique to her growing collection of blooms.

                <h3>Crossandra (<em>Crossandra infundibuliformis</em>)</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    This flower is everywhere in my lola’s garden, as if it never wants to be unnoticed. 
                    It spreads its bright color freely, filling the space with life. 
                    It has been there for as long as I can remember, one of the originals in her garden. 
                    Its presence makes everything feel lively and full.
